The housing market in the greater Boston area has become highly competitive. It is economically and informationally beneficial for brokers, appraisers, lenders, buyers and/or sellers to understand specifically which characteristics of homes are the most valuable. The purpose of this project is to determine: What home characteristics are the most important for explaining the variation in home prices in the greater Boston area? 

## Data 
The CS 350H independent study group developed a web scraping program that collects housing information from an online real estate platform. I used this dataset to analyze 88,412 recent housing transactions across 192 zip codes from 2020 to 2023. 

## Analysis 
Refer to final R code for analysis. The multiple linear regression model includes 14 predictors and explains 68.55% of variation in home prices in the greater Boston area.
